</div>

### Description

This is a Big 2 Game that use winsock to go online. The game is still being created and only features singles, doubles, triples and quads. Jokers and poker hands are sill being created. This was here for comments and feedbacks for future version and Ai tips. Hopefully a dedicated server will be out soon. Further instructions will be in the Read me File. Plz put comments. This was not created for the voting contest though.
