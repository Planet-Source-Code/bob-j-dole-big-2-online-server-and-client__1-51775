Thanks for looking at the Big 2 file.
This is an early version: no jokers, 2 aren't "BIG"
I would make it into a fully fledged game with a dedicated server, (like microsoft's zone) so you can play it any time
FOr now you can send the Clients to your friend in order to play.
BTW it must be a 4 player game

Trouble shooting:


XP controls only work when you compile!

INSTRUCTIONS:


Testing it out?

Compile prjClient
Run 3 instances (dbl click 3 times)
Open server project (or compule)
RUN (DUH!)
Click on the COnnect button (after connect should be greyed)

Go to one of the client forms, type in 4568
Hit connect (wait until label says CONNECTED)
Hit secure
Go to another type 4569
Hit connect (wait until label says CONNECTED)
Hit secure
GO to the last type 4570
Hit connect (wait until label says CONNECTED)
Hit secure

card screen should pop up
Click cards to highlight, Click play to play ( i assume you not how to play it, no poker hand)
Click pass to pass.  Person who gets rid of the cards wins.


Yah, it is dumb for playing for 4 players by yourself

Playing with your friends?
Change the ip address in the client version (you find it yourself) to your ip
send the exe, winxp.res and pictures in a zip/ folder
You run the server, and teach them how to connect
